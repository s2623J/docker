    Notes:
    ------
    Docker vs Virtual Machine:
        1.  Docker does NOT replicate OS as VM - merely provides an interface/emulator instead
                
    Docker CLI:
        Provides way to interact with Docker Rest API to Docker server

    Docker File:
        Defines the components that make up the Docker image using the Docker CLI
        Find Base Image with: "wsl -l -v"

    Docker Hub:
        A large online repository for many popular Docker images
        Push to Docker Hub:
            1.  Login at prompt with "docker login"
            2.  If image is NOT tagged, assign it a tag (ie. "docker tag d127278dda39 nwdave1/nodejs-app")
            3.  Push to Docker Hub via prompt (ie. "docker push nwdave1/nodejs-app")

    Desktop App:
        Start an account with hub.docker.com and download
        Confirm install with "docker --version" or "docker version"
        View system installed images with "docker images -a"

    Hello World App Example Image:
        Navigate to "https://hub.docker.com/r/tutum/hello-world"
        Run "docker pull tutum/hello-world"
        Run "docker run -p 3001:80 tutum/hello-world"
        Confirm is running by typing "docker ps" and navigating to "http://localhost:3001/"
        Stop app by typing "docker run -p 3004:4000 d127278dda39" (d127278dda39 = image ID)
        Start app by typing "docker start a706ee2c7afa"

    Dockerfile:
        Used to construct Docker Container with the command: "docker build ."
        After the build, an image may NOT be visible in VS. To see it, type "docker images"
