    Notes:
    ------
    Docker vs Virtual Machine:
        1.  Docker does NOT replicate OS as VM - merely provides an interface/emulator instead
                
    Docker CLI:
        Provides way to interact with Docker Rest API to Docker server

    Docker File:
        Defines the components that make up the Docker image using the Docker CLI
        Find Base Image with: "wsl -l -v"

    Docker Hub:
        A large online repository for many popular Docker images
        Push to Docker Hub:
            1.  Login at prompt with "docker login"
            2.  If image is NOT tagged, assign it a tag (ie. "docker tag d127278dda39 nwdave1/nodejs-app")
            3.  Push to Docker Hub via prompt (ie. "docker push nwdave1/nodejs-app")

    Desktop App:
        Start an account with hub.docker.com and download
        Confirm install with "docker --version" or "docker version"
        View system installed images with "docker images -a"

    Hello World App Example Image:
        Navigate to "https://hub.docker.com/r/tutum/hello-world"
        Run "docker pull tutum/hello-world"
        Run "docker run -p 3001:80 tutum/hello-world"
        Confirm is running by typing "docker ps" and navigating to "http://localhost:3001/"
        Stop app by typing "docker run -p 3004:4000 d127278dda39" (d127278dda39 = image ID)
        Start app by typing "docker start a706ee2c7afa"

    Dockerfile:
        Used to construct Docker Container with the command: "docker build ."
        After the build, an image may NOT be visible in VS. To see it, type "docker images"

    Kubernetes:
        Used to automate deployments with scaling and automation services
        Image:  Master controls the deployed/load-balanced instances
            Key-Value Store:    Contains configuration data
            Pod:                Think container of containers
            Kube-Proxy:         Manages IP 
            Kublet:             Constantly communicates with the api-Server
        Kubernetes Minikube:
            Tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally.
            Runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a local VM 
            Installation:   https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/
            Installation:   https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows/#install-kubectl-binary-with-curl-on-windows
            Installation:   https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
            Start with:                     "minikube start"
            Check status with:              "minikube status"
            Verify active services with:    "kubectl get services"
            Configuration for the deployment is detailed in a ".yaml" file
            Create a deployment with:       "kubectl create -f .\tutum-deployment.yaml"
            Display Dashboard with:         "minikube dashboard"
            Launch in browser by right-clcking on service and selecting "Launch in browser"
