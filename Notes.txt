    Notes:
    ------
    Docker vs Virtual Machine:
        1.  Docker does NOT replicate OS as VM - merely provides an interface/emulator instead
                
    Docker CLI:
        Provides way to interact with Docker Rest API to Docker server

    Docker File:
        Defines the components that make up the Docker image using the Docker CLI

    Docker Hub:
        A large online repository for many popular Docker images

    Desktop App:
        Start an account with hub.docker.com and download
        Confirm install with "docker --version" or "docker version"
        View system installed images with "docker images -a"

    Hello World App Example Image:
        Navigate to "https://hub.docker.com/r/tutum/hello-world"
        Run "docker pull tutum/hello-world"
        Run "docker run -p 3001:80 tutum/hello-world"
        Confirm is running by typing "docker ps" and navigating to "http://localhost:3001/"
        Stop app by typing "docker stop a706ee2c7afa" (a706ee2c7afa = container ID)
        Start app by typing "docker start a706ee2c7afa"
